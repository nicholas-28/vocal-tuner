# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-001 — Start as a web application

Status: accepted

The first version will be a mobile-first web application rather than a native App Store application.

Reasons:

- fastest path to testing;
- accessible through one link;
- avoids store availability problems;
- simpler deployment;
- sufficient browser audio capabilities for technical validation.

Revisit when browser limitations materially block the product.

## ADR-002 — No backend for MVP

Status: accepted

Pitch analysis and reference tones will run locally.

Reasons:

- privacy;
- lower complexity;
- no account requirement;
- no infrastructure cost;
- lower latency.

## ADR-003 — Canvas for the pitch monitor

Status: accepted

The scrolling pitch history will use Canvas rather than one DOM element per point.

Reasons:

- high update rate;
- efficient custom rendering;
- predictable mobile performance;
- easier timeline scrolling.

## ADR-004 — Fractional MIDI for graph coordinates

Status: accepted

Pitch will be represented as fractional MIDI values for visualization.

Reasons:

- equal spacing for semitones;
- direct mapping to note names and cents;
- simpler vertical layout.

## ADR-005 — Separate raw, filtered, and rendered pitch

Status: accepted

The system will retain conceptual separation between detector output, musical filtering, and visual smoothing.

Reasons:

- easier debugging;
- less misleading display behavior;
- future analytics;
- safer tuning of the UI.
